# FZA_lensless_imaging
The MATLAB codes allow simulation/experiment and compressive reconstruction of an single-shot lensless imaging using Fresnel zone aperture (FZA). They are based on the paper:

Jiachen Wu, Hua Zhang, Wenhui Zhang, Guofan Jin, Liangcai Cao, and George Barbastathis, "Single-shot lensless imaging with fresnel zone aperture and incoherent illumination," Light: Science & Applications 9, 53 (2020).
